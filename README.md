Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture (AI/ML)
This project involves building a machine learning-based system to identify plant diseases and recommend suitable crops and fertilizers.
 The system processes images of plant leaves to detect symptoms of diseases.
 It also takes into account environmental factors such as soil quality and weather conditions to optimize crop productivity.
